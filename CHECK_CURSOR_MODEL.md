# How to Check Your Cursor Model

## Quick Check

1. **Open Cursor Settings:**
   - Press `Ctrl+,` (or `Cmd+,` on Mac)
   - Or go to: File → Preferences → Settings

2. **Look for AI/Model Settings:**
   - Search for "model" or "AI" in settings
   - Check for options like:
     - "Model" or "AI Model"
     - "Claude" or "GPT" model selection
     - "Max" vs "Standard" or "Regular"

3. **Check Subscription/Usage:**
   - Look for "Subscription" or "Usage" in settings
   - This usually shows your plan and model tier

## Common Model Names

- **Max/Pro models:** Usually named like "Claude Sonnet", "GPT-4", "Claude Opus"
- **Regular/Standard:** Usually "Claude Haiku", "GPT-3.5", "Claude Sonnet" (lower tier)

## Alternative: Check Usage Panel

- Look for a usage indicator in the Cursor UI
- Usually shows remaining requests/tokens
- May indicate which model tier you're on

## What You're Likely Using

Based on the usage warning, you're probably on:
- A **limited plan** (not unlimited)
- Either **Max** or **Regular** depending on your subscription

The best way to know for sure is to check your Cursor settings or subscription page.
