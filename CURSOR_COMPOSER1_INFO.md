# Cursor Composer1 Model Info

## What is Composer1?

**Composer1** is likely one of Cursor's AI models or modes. Based on Cursor's architecture:

- **Composer** = Cursor's AI coding assistant feature
- **Composer1** = Likely the first/standard version of Composer

## Is it Max or Regular?

**Composer1** is typically the **regular/standard** mode, not Max Mode.

### Regular Mode (Composer1):
- Standard context window
- Faster responses
- More quota-efficient
- Good for most tasks

### Max Mode:
- Maximum context window (200k+ tokens)
- Slower but more capable
- Uses more quota
- Better for very large codebases

## How to Check if Max Mode is Enabled

1. Look for a "Max" toggle or indicator in Cursor
2. Check if there's a "Max Mode" option in settings
3. Max Mode is usually an **optional toggle**, not the default

## Your Current Setup

If it says **"Composer1"**, you're likely using:
- ✅ Regular/Standard mode (more quota-efficient)
- ✅ Good balance of speed and capability
- ✅ Not using Max Mode (which would be explicitly shown)

## To Enable Max Mode (if needed)

- Look for "Max Mode" toggle in Cursor settings
- Or check the model selector dropdown
- Max Mode is usually optional and costs more quota

## Summary

**Composer1 = Regular/Standard mode** (not Max Mode)

This is good for quota management! Max Mode would be explicitly labeled if enabled.
