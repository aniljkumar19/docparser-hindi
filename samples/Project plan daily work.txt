Your Weekly Schedule (Designed for Success)

Below is a battle-tested schedule that balances depth (RCM) + breadth (DocParser) + consistency (CompeteTracker).

🔥 MONDAY–FRIDAY SCHEDULE (4–6 hours/day)
🕐 1 PM – 3 PM → Healthcare RCM (2 hours deep work)

This is the #1 company.
We will work on:

Eligibility Autopilot MVP

Prior Auth Automation (Phase 2)

Denial Classification Model

Provider Portal crawling automation

Intake → Task → Appeal → Fax/Email workflows

Build the pipeline of 30 clinics

Build 1 pilot customer ASAP ($1–3k/mo)

Every day, we’ll focus on ONE module.

🕒 3 PM – 4 PM → DocParser (1 hour)

Slow and steady build:

GST parser

Invoice classifier

Bank statement extractor

Tally XML importer

Canonical JSON format

CA dashboard

API + pricing

WhatsApp integration

This SaaS can hit ₹50,000–₹1 lakh MRR with consistency.

🕓 4 PM – 4:45 PM → CompeteTracker (45 min)

Daily small wins:

Fix scraper reliability

Improve landing funnel

Outreach to 10 merchants

Add one micro-feature a day

Improve demo

Add 1–2 users/day (realistic)

Step-by-step momentum will grow it without stress.

🕔 4:45 PM – 5 PM → Admin / Planning (15 min)

Identify next day’s tasks

Move items to tomorrow’s focus

Quick notes on blockers

Send any test payloads or deploys

This keeps you sharp and organized.

📅 SATURDAY (8 hours deep work)

Your superpower day.
We focus on ONE big push every Saturday.

I recommend alternating weeks:

Week 1 – Healthcare RCM

Build a full workflow end-to-end:

PDF → Eligibility Extractor

Portal login automation

Scrape benefit info

Normalize to JSON

Push to dashboard

Generate denial/PA form templates

Test with real clinic sample PDFs

Week 2 – DocParser

Ship major chunks:

GSTR-2B parser

E-invoice API integration

Ledger mapping

Tally XML full flow

Add users to start testing

Build accountant workspace

Week 3 – Healthcare RCM

Next pipeline
Next automations

Week 4 – CompeteTracker

Full homepage redesign

True competitor auto-suggestions

Browser extension

Faster scrapers

Auto-weekly competitor summary email

Generate 20 new users

This approach gives every project a deep, uninterrupted 8-hour push.

📅 SUNDAY (Optional 1–2 hours)

Review logs

Map out next week

Fix small bugs

Send outreach messages

Prepare tasks for Monday

🎯 Revenue Targets (Realistic & Aggressive)
Healthcare RCM

Month 3: 1 clinic at $1k–$2k/mo

Month 6: 3–5 clinics = $5k–$10k/mo

Long term: 20 clinics = $30k–$50k/mo

This is the 1M–10M ARR company.

DocParser India

Month 2: 50 paying users = ₹50k MRR

Month 4: 150 users = ₹1.5 lakh MRR (~$1,800/mo)

Long term: CA networks & B2B = ₹5–10 lakh MRR

This becomes a strong India SaaS.

CompeteTracker

Month 2: 20–40 free users

Month 3–4: 5–10 paying users ($200–$400/mo)

Month 6+: If traction, add AI competitor insights

Micro-SaaS with upside but no stress.

🧘 Why This Split Works

Because:

You have the energy

You have the discipline

You have real engineering speed

You have cross-project synergy

You avoid getting “stuck” on one thing

Each project still moves forward meaningfully

No burnout (because time is structured)

This is the EXACT system founders with multiple products use.

🚀 Ready to begin?

If yes, I will generate:

1. Daily Task Board for all 3 projects

(Healthcare RCM, DocParser, CompeteTracker)

2. 7-day execution plan starting tomorrow
3. Exact roadmap for this week (Monday–Saturday)

Just confirm:

👉 Is this the schedule you want to commit to?
